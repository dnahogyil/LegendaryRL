# prototype

**Summary**:

This is the beginning of a collaboration between an idea guy and two relatively junior developers from reddit that found each other on r/roguelikes. Hopefully this will eventually be open for pull request from the public as well as having a working game.

**Language**:

We will be using Python 3.5.3 as it's a standard distribution and can easily be read and added to.

**Discord**:

Open invitation link to bring interested parties together.

**Game Website**:

We will be working to make a Github Pages website when the time is appropriate.
