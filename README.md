# prototype

**Summary**:

This is the beginning of a collaboration between an idea guy and two relatively junior developers from reddit that found each other on r/roguelikes. Hopefully this will eventually be open for pull request from the public as well as having a working game.

**Language**:

We will be using Python 3.5.3 as it's a standard distribution and can easily be read and added to.

**Discord**:

<https://discord.gg/WRwSvNd>

Open invitation link to bring interested parties together.

**Game Website**:

We will be working to make a Github Pages website when the time is appropriate.

**Attributions**:

We are working from a libtcodpy tutorial base that can be found here:

<http://rogueliketutorials.com/tcod/>

It was transcribed accurately by EpikMaowPhailure and we will be modifying it to the point
of unrecognizability as we make this game but it is important to note where it came from. It is
an up-to-date and modularized take on older versions of the libtcodpy tutorial.
