# Perks && Powers

## *Spells*

Spells are activated from the spell menu, putting the player into a “channeling” state, doing nothing else for the duration. The player can continue channeling by pressing the wait/hide button, or cancel the channel by performing any other action, including casting a new spell. Channeling has the same effect on stealth value that moving around does. After channeling for a number of rounds determined by the spell, the spell takes effect and the player reverts to a normal state.

The effects that spells have scale with spell power, a hidden stat determined by wisdom and item bonuses.

**Brilliance**: 4 turns. Targeted space becomes the center of a very powerful light source. A moderate area of effect around the origin of this light source (such that it covers the same tiles as the ones "brightly lit" by the light source) grants a moderate accuracy malus to anything inside of it, except the caster.

**Call Lightning**: 5 turns. Deals a large amount of lightning damage in a small aoe radius, centered on a targeted point that can be placed through obstructions, but must be in an area without a ceiling, and must be within line of sight.

**Call Fog**: 4 turns. Creates a large hidden area of effect centered on a targeted space (place anywhere, line of sight unnecessary). Spaces in this area of effect will randomly emit “Fog” gas for a long duration. The result is fog appearing in that area over a number of turns, potentially spilling into areas outside the radius if possible. 3 consecutive tiles of fog block line of sight for everything but the player, and any creature standing a fog space receives a significant hide bonus and a small sneak bonus. Unlike other effects that alter terrain, this makes no noise.

**Chilling Coalescence**: 5 turns. All enemies in a small aoe suffer the "coalescence" debuff for a short time, taking light cold damage and suffering slow movement for the duration. Empty tiles within the aoe have a 20% chance of becoming ice block walls for the duration of the spell.

**Fireball**: 3 turns. Shoots a projectile which, upon hitting an enemy, a wall, or the targeted space, deals moderate fire damage in a moderate aoe. Notably, damage dropoff only reaches half damage at the edge of the radius, unlike other aoe damage effects. The projectile has a speed of 4 spaces per round. Fireball deals (60-Spellpower)% damage to the caster.

**Lightning Bolt**: 3 turns. Shoots an instantaneous projectile which can travel through any number of enemy spaces, dealing moderate lightning damage to each enemy it passes through.

**Divination**: 7 turns. Establishes a moderate area of effect around a targeted space, chosen with no restrictions. That area is immediately mapped, including traps and items, and player has complete telepathy within that area for a short duration, detecting all creatures regardless of stealth value.

**Acid Splash**: 3 turns. Shoots a projectile which, upon hitting an enemy, a wall, or the targeted space, creates acid terrain on the location. At wisdom 5, this means an acid puddle on the space itself and two other adjacent spaces, but at high spellpower this could mean a large area with deep acid in the middle. Any enemy struck by the projectile takes moderate acid damage.

**Chilling Grip**: 2 turns. Targeted enemy in sight immediately takes light cold damage, ignoring armor.

**Conjure Ammunition**: 7 turns. Spawns a full quiver of a type of ammo corresponding to an equipped ranged weapon (if no ammo is equipped, spawns a Belt of Knives). This ammo will have a small enhancement bonus determined by spellpower. This object is temporary and will disappear between levels.

**Wind Step**: 4 turns. Causes targeted creature (including the player) to gain the Wind Step buff for a short duration. This buff makes movement instant on a 2 turn cooldown, grants Flight, and grants a moderate dodge bonus.

**Cold Wind**: 5 turns. The player is prompted to target a space, and then set a direction. A special effect fills a moderate-size, roughly rectangular area. Enemies within this effect take light cold damage and are knocked back a very short distance in the direction that was set. The player is unaffected.

**Dispel**: 3 turns. Affects a targeted space within line of sight. An instant anti-magic effect is applied to all creatures and objects in that space, removing any ongoing magical effects. Magical enemies gain the “nullified” debuff for a short duration, losing the ability to channel any spells, and possibly certain intrinsics. Undead are dealt light damage. Constructs are dealt heavy damage.

**Flash**: 2 turns. A small area of effect a short range away from the caster. Spaces in this area become Brightly Lit for 1 round. Enemies in this area take light fire damage, and are blinded for a short duration if the space they were standing in was formerly Dark, or they have Light Sensitivity.

**Scouring Wind**: 4 turns. A targeted enemy is afflicted with the "scoured" debuff for a very short period of time. This debuff has the following effects each round: the enemy will take light physical damage each round. The enemy will be disarmed if possible. The enemy will suffer a small amount of armor corrosion. The enemy will be knocked back very little, in a direction set by the caster upon casting the spell. 

**Shardspray**: 3 turns. This spell creates a scaling number of projectiles that immediately fire off in random directions. If cast on the floor, these can be in any of 16 directions (the 8 movement directions, plus 1 in between each of them). If cast on a wall, adjacent walls will prevent shards from firing in their direction, resulting in a more concentrated burst of shards. Each shard deals light physical damage and has high accuracy. These projectiles go through the player without triggering any effects. With this spell, the projectiles originate adjacent to the space targeted, and thus an enemy on a targetted floor space will be undamaged.

**Lava Fissure**: 5 turns. Targetted space in short range, no los required. A small area around the targetted space becomes highly dangerous "spell-lava" terrain. This terrain is identical to lava, except that all damage it causes scales with spellpower and is reduced by 90% when applied to the player.

**Bless Equipment**: 10 turns. Applies a “blessed” trait to a piece of equipment, increasing its effective enhancement bonus by a figure that scales with spellpower. This trait is removed when the spell is cast again, and between levels. (Enemies who use a scroll of bless equipment gain a permanent attack buff, and lose “keeps distance”)

**Blast of Wind**: 3 turns. Fires a short-range projectile that can penetrate any number of enemies. Enemies hit take light physical damage and are knocked back a short distance.

**Stone Body**: 6 turns. The player gains the “Stone Body” buff, gaining a small bonus to armor for a moderate duration and increasing armor apply chance by a small amount. The player also gains resistance to lightning and fire, and slow movement, for the same duration.

**Shadows**: 5 turns. Creates a moderate-sized area of effect. This effect makes the spaces inside dark with a high priority. It also applies a "fade" buff to the caster as long as they are within the area, granting a small bonus to Hide. This spell only makes noise if it affects a space that is brightly lit.

**Brutish Transformation**: 10 turns. For a long duration, the player gains a moderate bonus to melee damage, melee attack rolls, parry value, and armor value. The player cannot access the inventory, interact with items, or use Feats or Tricks.

**Craven Transformation**: 10 turns. For a long duration, the player gains a moderate bonus to stealth value, bonus damage from stealth, and movement speed, and a small bonus to dodge. The player cannot make attack rolls against aware enemies, and has their “Guard” down for the duration.

**Torpid Transformation**: 8 turns. For a long duration, the player gains +5 spellpower, casts spells at 125% spellpower, subtracts 1 from the channel time for all spells, and gains temporary ability to cast 2 additional random spells. The player suffers a crippling penalty to speed, does not receive armor bonuses from equipment, cannot make melee attacks or fire ranged weapons, cannot dodge, and has the “guard down” debuff for the duration.

**Command**: 6 turns. Target an enemy in line-of-sight, within a moderate range. For a short duration, this enemy is afflicted with the command status. An enemy with this status does not act on its own, but prompts the player to act for it each time it would take a turn. Actions taken this way can anger neutrals, causing them to become permantly hostile to the commanded enemy's pack. Creatures friendly to the commanded target, including the target's own packmates, can become temporarily angered and hostile, ONLY to the commanded target. They will become friendly again when the effect ends.

**Read Magic**: 2 turns. Once cast, the player is prompted to choose a scroll or scribe’s scraps from their inventory. If an unidentified scroll is chosen, that scroll is identified. If an identified scroll is chosen, the player begins to cast that spell as if from their spell list without consuming the scroll (this is cast at 75% normal spellpower). If scribe’s scraps are chosen, the player is prompted to turn it into one of three scrolls (taken from the list of identified scrolls).

## *Tricks*

**Assassinate**: Unlocks a critical strike option with a +200% damage multiplier. If the enemy dies, their death does not make any extra noise (same sneak/hide malus as moving). If the attack deals sneak attack damage (such as against an unaware target) that damage is tripled as well.

**Camoflage**: At the start of each mission, a number of "camoflage" items spawn on the floor of the level. Upon pick-up, these items disappear and grant you a small bonus to hide that will last until you leave the level. The number of camoflage items in a level depends on your Cunning.

**Poisoncraft**: Damage dealt to enemies that is caused by the effects of coating a weapon with a potion is increased by a figure that scales with your Cunning. 1 extra Potion of Poison is spawned on the floor of every mission.

**Disappearing Act**: Activate from the special abilities menu. For 5 turns, you gain a large bonus to Sneak and Hide and enemies can lose track of you even if you are still in their vision zone. Usable once per mission.

**Statue Gambit**: You receive a small (additional) bonus to Sneak and a large (additional) bonus to Hide when standing still.

**Alchemist**: Immediately identify 7 random potions, starting with those in your inventory, if applicable. At the start of each level, receive a random potion. If you pick up “alchemical scraps” you will be prompted to turn it into one of three potions (taken from the list of identified potions).

**Sniper**: While standing still (and not casting/reloading), while holding a ranged weapon, you gain a stacking “aim” bonus that greatly improves accuracy and slightly improves damage multiplier. The number of aim stacks you can accrue is equal to Cunning. Stacks are removed if you do anything besides stand still.

**Opportunist**: Every enemy with its guard up has a % chance to drop it at the end of its turn equal to twice your Cunning. Sneak attack damage is applied to critical hits on aware enemies.

**Elocution**: You now gain a spellpower bonus from Cunning, applicable only when using scrolls. Scrolls are cast in 2 fewer turns.

**Uncanny Dodge**: Increase the rate of scaling for dodge bonus from Cunning slightly. You are not limited to dodging once per round, and can even dodge the same attack multiple times. This can allow the player to dodge their way out of AOE effects by making multiple checks in a row.

**Thief**: Unlocks a critical strike option that deals no damage and always hits. The player is prompted to take any items in the enemy’s inventory that they choose. If possible, the enemy suffers the “disarmed” debuff. This does not make any extra noise (same sneak/hide malus as moving), and the target is not automatically alerted to the player. Additionally, the first time you pick an item off the ground each round, the action is instant and silent.

**Quick Hands**: Automatically activates when you draw a weapon, put one away, throw something, or spend a turn reloading. That action becomes instant. After it activates, it goes on cooldown for two turns.

**River’s Current**: The base speed bonus from sprinting is increased (20->30). Sprinting is not unstealthy (Same hide/sneak malus as normal movement). Sprinting grants a dodge bonus for its duration. You suffer only 3 stacks of fatigue for each 5 rounds spent sprinting.

## *Feats*
**Charge**: When moving while sprinting, you gain stacks of a buff which increases the damage modifier of the next melee attack you make. An attack benefiting from any number of these stacks increases its Cleave value by 1. You can accrue a number of these stacks up to your Valor. While fatigued, you do not take penalties to your combat stats.

**Battle Stamina**: Whenever you kill an enemy with a weapon attack, heal HP equal to 4 plus the enemy's tier, times the enemy's tier. So for tiers 1, 2, and 3, that's 5, 12, and 21.

**Berserk**: When you make a “Reckless” attack, any critical attack except “Cautious”, or spend a turn bonestuck, you gain a stack of the “Berserk” buff that grants small bonuses to dodge and armor and large bonuses to melee damage and accuracy. You can accrue a number of berserk stacks equal to your Valor. Stacks are lost at a rate of 1 each round you do not gain a stack.

**Blood Rage**: Whenever you kill an enemy with an attack, gain stacks of Berserk equal to its tier+2. Whenever you take damage from an attack, gain a stacks of berserk equal to 1/10th the damage, rounded down. **Requires Berserk**.

**Rapid Strikes**: Unlocks a normal attack and a critical attack. The normal attack consists an unmodified attack that, once resolved, triggers another unmodified attack next turn, followed by a third attack which is instantaneous but otherwise unmodified. This effectively allows the player to make 3 attacks against the same space in 2 turns. The critical version of this attack has a 1.2 damage multiplier. If it hits, the target is stunned for 1 round. This attack triggers additional attacks, much like the normal version, except with the 1.2 damage multiplier.

**Follow-Through**: Increases the Cleave value of all your melee attacks by 1. Increases the number of enemies your projectile weapons can penetrate before stopping by 1. Grants a new critical strike, "Hewing Strike". This attack deals triple damage and drops guard. Like other critical strikes, it does not cleave normally. However, it checks cleave, and targets adjacent enemies with attack using the "Reckless Attack" profile, according to the cleave number.

**Power Blow**: Standing still while holding a melee weapon causes you to gain stacks of the “Power Blow” buff, that are lost if you do anything else. When you’ve accrued 4 stacks you may use the “Power Blow” melee attack from the strike menu, which cannot be parried, has a large damage multiplier, and causes small knockback.

**Atlas Strength**: Double your Valor for the purpose of negating Encumbrance penalties.

**Diehard**: Once per level, when you would be killed, remain at 1 HP and become immune to HP loss for a number of rounds equal to your Valor.

**Dual-Wield**: When holding a weapon in your off-hand, each time you make an attack, you make an additional attack with the off-hand weapon with a -25% damage mod and no other modifiers except Valor bonuses.

**Uncanny Parry**: Increase the bonus to parry from Valor slightly. You can parry melee attacks that are normally unparry-able, such as those from large enemies. You can parry missile weapons. You can parry normal melee attacks from enemies outside your field of vision, as long as you are aware of those enemies.

**Bastion Stance**: Activate and deactivate from the special abilities menu. Gain “Strafe”, become unable to parry or dodge (guard is not down), and gain extra armor proportional to your parry bonus to all melee and ranged attacks that originate from enemies in front of you (180 degrees). While this feat is active, you have a single-width line blindspot in the middle of your vision field.

**Point Blank**: Guard is not dropped when reloading or firing a ranged weapon. Ranged attacks targeting spaces within 5 spaces receive a small accuracy and damage multiplier bonus that scales with valor.
