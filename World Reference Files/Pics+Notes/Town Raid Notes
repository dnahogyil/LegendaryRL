Town Raid Notes

This one is pretty incomplete. Just imagine more of the same to fill out the map.
Buildings in various shapes and sizes are arranged roughly in rows to form the streets and alleys of a town raid map.
These maps will put the player in conflict not only with some hostile force that is raiding the town,
but also likely the defender of the town as well. After all, there's looting to be done!

For all we know, the player's mission is to kill enough orcs without too many human NPCs dieing.
But for one reason or another, the player has decided they'll be having that Treasure in the big building.
The "G"s are guards... these guards are protecting their wharehouse, and will become hostile to anything that trespasses.

Our player is more in their element here... having heard the Guards on the other side of the doorway, they made a plan.
Thanks to their stealthy skills, the player was able to stay hidden until that orc pack was in just the right position.
They bashed down the door, sending the guards running after them... as well as the orcs!
Neither of these enemy types will distinguish between the player and hostile NPCs. A melee will ensue.

Having sprinted away, the player hides in a nearby building. It looks like they haven't outrun one of the guards though.
He's still closer to the player than the orc alpha, and still aware of the player, so he still moves to engage the player.
He might lose track of the player and double back to help his buddies. Or he might trap the player in the room...
Those guards will probably win the fight, given time. Hopefully they'll be wounded enough for the player to finish off!
