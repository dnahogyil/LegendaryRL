Pirate Notes

Our friend the player continues to find themselves in sticky situations.
They began the level on the cargo ship, the larger one on the right.

Their objective is to protect the captain "C".
The sailors "S" are weak melee combatants, but will fight to the death to defend their ship.

What's this on the horizon? A fast-moving pirate ship is closing in.
Each turn, it shifts 1 space closer to the cargo ship, bringing it's crew of orc pirates with it!
Once they spot enemies, orc runts crowd onto the boarding ramps. It's as close as they can get without going in the water.
These orcs are led by a vicious alpha, who will make quick work of a sailor one on one...
Orc Bowmen "B" are at the back, as they allow other orcs to swap places with them. They will start shooting soon.

Our player isn't particularly well equipped for this. They're more stealthy than strong, and don't have a bow.
But they do have a low ENC, letting them swim in deep water without taking a lot damage.
Their plan is half-baked, but working so far.

They've lept off their ship and swam towards the pirates', taking care to avoid the vision cone of orc runts.
Timing it so that the combat will begin soon, the player means to sneak behind the enemies.
With no vision cones their way, and the orcs soon to adopt the "Fighting" behavior, the player will have a big stealth advantage.
Hopefully it will be enough to get multiple stealth crits off, killing the bowmen at least.
If only they had a grenade!
