Shardspray/Cleave notes

This is just a couple of diagrams detailing the Cleave and Shardspray mechanics.

Cleave is pretty simple. If you have an axe or have the feat, you get points of cleave.
More points of cleave, more extra spaces targeted with melee attacks. Normally crits don't check cleave at all.
If you have the Follow-through and Charge feats, you have an axe, and that axe has the "Cleaving" ego, then you'd have cleave 4 (when you charge).

Shardspray is a spell and a potion. The lines indicate "directions" that such an effect might shoot projectiles.
Note that these are just possibilities, which direction the shards go is random.
So when the spell is cast on a wall, blocknig walls can make the burst more concentrated.
