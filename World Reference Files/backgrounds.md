Great Spear, Hat, Leather Boots, Dagger

Potion of Healing, Potion of Strength (both ID’d)

## **Smith’s Apprentice**

2 Valor, 1 Wisdom

Mace, Breastplate, Gauntlets, Shield

“Life in the forge has beaten your body strong, but also sharpened your intellect! You chanced upon an opportunity to steal some good armor, and a shield. Between that and your trusty hammer, you are finally prepared to claim glory in your true calling, as an Adventurer!”

## **Scribe’s Apprentice**

3 Wisdom

Staff, Silk Shirt, 2 Scrolls of Identify, 4 Random Scrolls (all ID’d)

“You know enough to know that you’re going to need more than what you have if you’re going to make it. But you know that what you have is a great way to get what you need! You’re close to something great, you can feel it!”

## **Pit Fighter**

2 Valor, 1 Cunning

Random Onehanded Weapon, Buckler, Dagger, Bolas, 30 Gold

“You’re not like these other fools, all starry eyed, full of pride and hope. If they can be tales, you’ll be a REAL legend. Because you know how a real fight works. Same way the world works. Gold for steel for blood for gold.”

## **Noble**

1 Valor, 2 Wisdom

Longsword, Chainmail, 2 Random Scrolls (both ID’d), 60 Gold

“The eldest got the land. The second-eldest got the marriage. The third got the cushy job in the capital. But you have your education, a purse full of gold and the family sword. You are destined for greatness above them all, you must simply take it!”

## **Thief**

3 Cunning

Dagger, Cloak, Hood, Soft Shoes, 30 Gold

“You grew up on the streets, nicking anything you could get away with. Everything you’ve ever had, you took, because no one would give it to you. And you’re still alive. Why should you settle for scraps, when you get cursed and hunted for taking anything at all? The world owes you nothing, so you shall nab glory out from under its nose!”

## **Monk**

Staff, Cloak, Soft Shoes, Dagger, 2 Random Scrolls (all ID’d)

## **Alchemist’s Apprentice**

2 Cunning, 1 Wisdom

Dagger, Cloak, Sling, 5 Random Potions (all ID’d)

“You’ve always loved potions. Wondrous, magical things, they! That is why you wanted to learn the trade. But as you soon realized, if you make them sell, you don’t get to use them! And who has a use for jar that explodes when thrown, or a tonic that makes you grow twice your size? Only an adventurer, of course!”

## **Hunter**

1 Valor, 2 Cunning

Bow, Dagger, Leather Boots, Cloak, Hood

“You’ve stalked and killed mighty beasts. You’ve seen monsters and bandits and evil spirits and survived it all. Surely you’re fit for glory! If the wilds of this land send you something you haven’t seen before, you’ll do what you’ve always done. Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.”

“It’s like the old one always said. Sometimes you have to improvise. Sometimes, you have to know what you’re doing. And sometimes, you have to gird your loins and DO it. Plus, you’ve finally got your hands on all the stuff they said you’d need. So now you MUST be ready!”
