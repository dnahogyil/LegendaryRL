The Forest Cave

Here the player embarks on an early mission, to venture into a forest infested with orcs. This isn't an exterminate mission, and thus there are more orcs than they can expect to kill. So they are trying to avoid combat...

They entered from the exit at the north side. Seeing three orc runts "Milling" around near a big tree, they decide to go east instead. Since those orcs won't leave their camp on their own, hopefully that's three less orcs to deal with.

To head east, they had to cross a stream. This is shallow water, which costs them an extra turn to move through, some of the time. Not a big deal with no orcs around!

Most of this level is dim light. The orcs can see in it well, but not at the same distance the player can. This means the player was able to see those 5 wandering orc runts before they saw them! The player is hiding behind a big tree, an attempt at showing what the player's vision zone might be like has been made here.

The player is heading towards the cave in the center of the map. There is a staircase leading further into the level, where their objective is. Two orc runts are guarding the entrance... the player can take them, but hopes not to attract any more!

The tree to the southwest is hollow! Inside is a treasure chest, but the player might not notice it. 

Normally there would be items strewn over the ground randomly in a level. But I couldn't be arsed.
